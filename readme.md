# this is my first online project - ThroughMaze2House
## I am making a game about a ginger bread man who has to clear a maze to reach his house.
## How to play?
You play as jack frost. Your objective is to cover the ground with ice and freeze the fireboys to complete the game. There are elevators and ladders to assist you.

##details
- there are snowflakes on the way to collect
- Fireboys are your enemies. You die once you touch them
- To freeze the fireboys, you have to jump on them.They will freeze for 7 seconds
- The elevators and ladders also must be covered with ice
